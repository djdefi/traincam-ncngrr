### Feature Request: Add mDNS (Bonjour/zeroconf) Service Discovery to ESP32 Camera Server

#### Summary
This issue requests the addition of mDNS (Bonjour/zeroconf) service discovery to the ESP32 camera server. Implementing this feature will allow the device to be easily discovered on the local network by clients (such as Raspberry Pi) using a hostname like `traincam.local`.

#### Implementation Details
1. **Initialize mDNS in setup()**: Modify the setup function to initialize mDNS.
2. **Advertise HTTP Service**: Ensure that the HTTP service is advertised over mDNS.
3. **Documentation**: Include brief documentation in the code to guide users on how to utilize this feature.
4. **Reference File**: The implementation can be referenced in the file `camunit/espcameraserver.ino`.

This addition will greatly enhance the usability and accessibility of the ESP32 camera server.
