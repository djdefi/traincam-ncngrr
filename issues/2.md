### Feature: Secure WiFi Credential Management

#### Problem
Currently, WiFi credentials are:
- Hardcoded in ESP32 firmware (`CameraWebServer.ino`)
- Manually configured on each Pi via `nmcli`

This doesn't scale well and isn't secure for production deployments.

#### Proposed Solutions

**Option 1: Ansible Vault**
- Store WiFi credentials in encrypted Ansible vault
- Deploy to Pi during provisioning
- Pros: Secure, repeatable
- Cons: Requires vault password management

**Option 2: WiFi Provisioning Mode**
- ESP32/Pi boots into AP mode if no known network
- User connects and enters credentials via web form
- Credentials stored locally on device
- Pros: User-friendly, no hardcoding
- Cons: More complex firmware

**Option 3: USB/SD Card Bootstrap**
- Read credentials from file on first boot
- Delete file after configuring
- Pros: Simple, works offline
- Cons: Requires physical access

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No plaintext passwords in git repository
- [ ] Easy to provision new camera units
- [ ] Works in environments without internet
- [ ] Documented process for changing credentials
